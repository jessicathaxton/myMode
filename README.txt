MYMODE
	MyMode is a simple healthy-habit goal tracking web application. 

MYMODE'S GOALS

TECH / FRAMEWORK
	Built with:
	- Visual Studio Code 	- https://code.visualstudio.com/
	- FileZilla 		- https://filezilla-project.org/
	- XAMPP	(Apache, MySQL)	- https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html

FEATURES
	MyMode provides tracking and accountability of several basic healthy habits: drinking water, getting enough sleep, and exercising. 
	Additionally, users can create a custom habit which they work towards. Progress is logged daily by the user.

INSTALLATION
	- Download and unzip the 'final' folder, which contains the above indicated files
		- My file structure: 	C:\xampp\htdocs\233p\final
	- Place the files in a subfolder inside your 'htdocs' folder (or equivalent; wherever your live website files live).
	- Inside PHPmyAdmin, create a mySQL database. In the following step, you will need to create a connect script to this database.
	- Inside your main folder (xampp for me), create a folder called 'req'. This is where your connect script needs to be.
		- My file structure: 	C:\xampp\req
		- Connect script should be named "connect.php"
		- Connect script should use PDO, which is used throughout the project. Using MySQLi may cause conflicts.

API Reference
	There is currently one API called - boredAPI.com is a license- and token-free API available to the public. 
	The API is employed in this project through CURL/PHP.
	myMode has two files controlling the API: boredAPI.php and user.php, wherein activity and habit suggestions are made to each user when their dashboard loads.

HOW TO USE?
--- USER ---
	Create an account following the requirements indicated on index.php. 
	After account creation, go to login.php. 
	Sign into your account. 
		- You should be redirected to your dashboard, provided you do not have any extension stopping redirects.
	Fill out your personal goals.
	Daily, log progress toward your goals. Progress can be updated throughout the day; only the most recent log for that day will remain in the database.
	Logs are viewable after data has been logged to the mySQL database. The more days you track, the more interesting your logs are!

--- ADMIN ---
	Go to the admin portal, manage.php. 
	Sign in with a user who has admin priviledges (currently granted through PHPmyAdmin).
	Once signed in, you can view a variety of logs, change user passwords, and a few other things.
